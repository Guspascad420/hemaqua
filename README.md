# ðŸ§¬ Hemaqua
An AI-ready mobile platform to assess water quality through **fish hematology analysis**, **mollusk hemocyte analysis**, and **standard aquatic parameters** (DO, pH, temperature, etc).

> Originally built as a research-backed app that successfully led to a Scopus Q1 journal publication in 2025.

## ðŸ“± Tech Stack

- **Flutter** â€” Cross-platform mobile development
- **Firebase** â€” Auth & Realtime Database
- **Python / Streamlit (Web)** â€” Experimental analytics dashboard (WIP)
- **(Planned)**: AI integration for blood & cell detection (YOLOv8, ResNet)

## ðŸ”¬ Core Features

### âœ… Hematology Analysis (Fish Blood)
- Input parameters: Erythrocytes, Leukocytes, Hemoglobin, Hematocrit, etc
- Automatic status classification (Normal, Anemia, Infection)
- (Planned) AI cell detection from microscope images

### âœ… Hemocyte Analysis (Mollusks)
- Input parameters: THC, Hyalin, Granular, Semi-granular
- Status prediction based on reference ranges
- (Planned) Automated cell count via image detection

### âœ… Water Quality
- Calculate water health score based on:
    - Dissolved Oxygen (DO)
    - pH
    - Temperature
    - Ammonia, Nitrite, Nitrate, etc.
- Time-series parameter monitoring dashboard

### âœ… Species Detail Viewer
- Browse species data collected from field or lab
- View **Latin names**, **morphological descriptions**, and **ecological roles**
- Useful for cross-checking field observations and learning bioindicator functions
